## Detection and Analysis of Expressed Intergenic Elements in Bacterial RNA-seq Data
The baerhunter package comprises a set of tools for the prediction, annotation and filtering of 
bacterial intergenic expressed regions from RNA-seq data. In addition, it supports further stages 
of bacterial RNA-seq data analysis, such as transcript abundance quantification and differential 
gene expression testing. It also offers additional options for the selection of genomic features 
by their expression strength and editing of the annotation file.
